- Start an HTTP server to serve the page.

You can then access the web page at:
[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)


### Updating Wine Data

If the Excel file (`wine3.xlsx`) is modified, restart the server to refresh the data:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `http.server` (built-in)
- `jinja2`
- `pandas`
- `openpyxl`
